// Certainly! In JavaScript, both `for...in` and `for...of` loops are used for iteration, but they have different use cases and work with different types of data.

// 1. **`for...in` loop:**
//    - Iterates over the enumerable properties of an object, including properties in the prototype chain.
//    - Typically used for iterating over the keys (property names) of an object.
//    - Works well with objects and should not be used with arrays because it may not iterate in order and may include additional properties from the prototype chain.

   
   const obj = { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 };

   for (const key in obj) {
     console.log(key, obj[key]);
   }
   

// 2. **`for...of` loop:**
//    - Iterates over the values of an iterable object (arrays, strings, maps, sets, etc.).
//    - Does not work with plain objects; it's mainly used for collections of data.
//    - Provides a simpler syntax and guarantees the order of iteration.

   
   const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4];

   for (const value of arr) {
     console.log(value);
   }
   

// In summary, use `for...in` when you want to iterate over the properties of an object, and use `for...of` when you want to iterate over the values of an iterable object like an array. 
// It's important to choose the right loop for the type of data you are working with to avoid unexpected behavior.
